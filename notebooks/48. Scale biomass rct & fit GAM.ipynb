    "After the previous notebook (47) we have gone through all of the dead end metabolites and check wether or not they should be included in the biomass reaction. After doing so, we need to check that we get maximum of 1 g/gCDW when adding the stoichiometreisa and the weights of each compound together. Here I will check that.\n",

    "If our biomass reaction exceeds the 1g/1gCDW, we need to scale all stoichiometries down to max 1 g/gCDW by changing the assigned stoichiometries linearly. This notebook will cover that.\n",
